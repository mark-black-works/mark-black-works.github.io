Most of the main characters
in the series are musicians, and so there is a lot of music in every episode. All episodes are available to watch at
the ERT Archive. I have compiled a list of episodes with links to watch them at [Το μινόρε της αυγής][1]. Further, in
the page for every episode I have noted the songs that play in that episode.

For some more information and cast details see [To minore tis avgis][2] on IMDB.
