Most of the main characters
in the series are musicians, and so there is a lot of music in every episode. All episodes are available to watch at
the ERT Archive. I have compiled a list of episodes with links to watch them at &lt;a href=&quot;/tv-series/90b29f05-ec37-427c-b8fc-e09cdd4e28b3/?Το μινόρε της αυγής&quot;&gt;Το μινόρε της αυγής&lt;/a&gt;. Further, in
the page for every episode I have noted the songs that play in that episode.&lt;/p&gt;
